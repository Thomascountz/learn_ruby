# learn_ruby_first
Ruby practice from The Odin Project

From the origin readme found at https://github.com/TheOdinProject/learn_ruby_first

This is modified version of test-first.org's learn ruby project. See testfirst.org/learn_ruby for more information about how this will work. These test-first Ruby challenges have been forked from https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby and updated to use RSpec 3 instead of RSpec 2.
